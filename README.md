# Discord Bot Maker

## Currently working on:
- Adding plugin functionality
- Fixing themes so they can be updated
- Settings panel in the UI
- CLI panel in the UI

## Future projects:
- Allow user to use bot as an interface to talk through (can hear what people are saying in a selected voice chat, and they can hear you)
- @Requires a sound to play before the audio is transmitted (letting people in the voice channel know the bot can now hear/transmit audio)
